# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### Changing the PrimeReact Theme

To change the prime react theme just modify theme import in `theme.css` and `theme-dark.css` located in public theme with the theme you want to use in your application.

**Default Theme configuration**

- Theme ID : `theme-css`
- Theme name : `light`

**Note:** Remove the unnecessary theme folders from the public theme folder to run the application in much more efficient way.
